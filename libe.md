# Librarianship

## Research Interests
<p>I am currently conducting research on linked data semantics with Darnelle Melvin and Cory Lampert at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Some general research questions we have are: What advantage might graph visualization have for information seeking processes, especially for research and data management? Do data structures facilitate linked data retrieval more than others? How does graph visualization impact search & discovery applications?</p>

**Publications:** 
 * [WikiframeVG: A SPARQL Template-based Framework for Wikidata Graph Exploration and Visualization](https://osf.io/pbm8k/) - 2023

## Volunteer Cataloging Guidance
<p>I wrote this libguide for San Diego State University. The intended audience is student and volunteer catalogers who enhance faculty profiles stored on Wikidata.</p>

 * [SDSU Guide to Faculty Profile Enhancement](/docs/sdsu_libguide_profile_enhancement.docx)
 
## Information Literacy
<p>I developed a one-day session on information seeking approaches in the library. It was for a college expository writing course, the theme for which was detective fiction.</p>
