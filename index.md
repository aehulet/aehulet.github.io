## Welcome
<p>I am a metadata librarian and programmer, and I focus on digital collection development. This site contains a concise portfolio of my work in library and information science. My thanks goes out to the people who have helped me create these examples.</p>

## Collections and the Public Good
<p>With the advent of machine learning and large language models (AI), it is tempting to worry that people will simply "consult the oracle" rather than do the harder work of educating themselves at libraries and archives. But of course, like commercial search engines before them, AI tools are really recycling content created by educated people. Consequently, well organized and described collections remain foundational for both education and knowledge creation.</p>

## DEI As a Core Value in Metadata Development
<p>Our societies continue to wrongly marginalize many of their own communities, and we are all subject to the prejudiced mentalities that ultimely exclude and oppress women, racial, ethnic, and religious groups, and sexual minorities, among others. In order to resist these tendencies in myself, I cultivate my awareness of who I am working with, thinking about, and providing service to, so that my own work describing library and archival resources shows a record of inclusion and equity for marginalized communities. This is clearly the right thing to do: it drives accuracy, invites full participation in our democracy, and addresses the suffering we have caused our fellow citizens.</p>
