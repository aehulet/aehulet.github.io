## About Me
<p>I am a metadata librarian and programmer, and I focus on digital collection development. This site contains a concise portfolio of my work in library and information science. My thanks goes out to the people who have helped me create these examples.</p>

## Collections and the Public Good
<p>With the advent of machine learning and large language models (AI), it is tempting to worry that people will simply "consult the oracle" rather than do the harder work of educating themselves at libraries and archives. But of course, like commercial search engines before them, AI tools are really recycling content created by educated people. Consequently, well organized and described collections remain foundational for both education and knowledge creation.</p>

## DEI As a Core Value in Metadata Development
<p>Our societies continue to wrongly marginalize many of their own communities, and we are all subject to the prejudiced mentalities that ultimely exclude and oppress many racial, ethnic, and religious groups, sexual minorities, and women, among others. In order to resist these tendencies in myself, I cultivate my awareness of who I am working with, thinking about, and providing service to, so that my own work describing library and archival resources shows a record of inclusion and equity for marginalized communities. This is clearly the right thing to do: it drives accuracy, invites more participation in our democracy, and addresses the suffering we have caused our fellow citizens.</p>

## Improving Search and Discovery
<p>While the importance of keyword searching is a given, search tools should also let users incorporate structured metadata into their queries via subject facets, date ranges, geography, and so forth. This is the basis for locating harder-to-find materials that are highly relevant. In my system development work, I look for strategies to enrich resource descriptions as much as possible, addressing both the standard and unique aspects of a resource. The search tools should in turn exploit that richness, allowing users to quickly assess the relevance of search results and see meaningful connections to related resources. To this end, metadata are best staged and accessed as linked open data, which let users visualize and follow links between things. What better outcome could there be for a searcher than finding a relevant special collection at a library, only to immediately discover an even more relevant resource at an archives nearby? Investing in linked data will make such occurrences more frequent over time.</p>
