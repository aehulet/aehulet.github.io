# Metadata Approach
## Modeling Works in BIBFRAME
<p>BIBFRAME, the works cataloging ontology from Library of Congress, promised to improve catalog accessibility and accuracy by storing metadata as linked data. In the below examples, I show the results of my effort to effectively catalog the Hackett Publishing instance of the Tao Te Ching as BIBFRAME. The existing entries at id.loc.gov have several problems: a later version of the work, published by Shambala, is listed as a separate work with its own instance rather than a new instance of the same work; several discrepancies exist between the two work entries; neither work refers to the appropriate work hub, that is, the original chinese text.
